# Cancer Prediction Project with Streamlit

This project is a cancer prediction tool built with **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
It uses **Machine Learning**, specifically **Logistic Regression**, to classify and predict cancer diagnosis based on patient data.  
Additionally, it integrates with **Gemini**, an AI-powered system, to provide personalized advice and recommendations for patients.
